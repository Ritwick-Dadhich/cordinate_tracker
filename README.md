Coordinate  Tracker is a cross platform application, built using Ionic Framework,  using languages HTML, SCSS and TypeScript.

Option to start or stop tracking the location.

It will continuously update the user's coordinates even when running in background.

For storing user location data I have used Firebase Real Time Database.

Whenever a user starts tracking on his device his location is captured and stored in the database from where admin can keep track of location of each user.
